platform for Clojure, yet a lot of its tools and tricks are unfamiliar to Clojure programmers. This talk will bring them to light and show you how the JVM facilities can make your Clojure work even more productive.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Alexander is a software engineer at Grammarly where he blurs the line between programming and natural languages. After being bitten by a radioactive spider with a lambda on its back, Alexander promised to use the obtained Lisp superpowers for good only. In his free time, he contributes to Clojure tooling like CIDER, studies distributed systems, and fills his half-full stack.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/simon.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/sbelak" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@sbelak</span></a><h3>Simon Belak</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Online statistical analysis using transducers and sketch algorithms">Online statistical analysis using transducers and sketch algorithms</h3><div class="description">Online statistical analysis using transducers and sketch algorithms. Don’t know what either is? You are going to learn something very cool (and perspective-changing) then. Know them, but want an experience report? Got you covered, fam.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Built my first computer out of Lego bricks and learned to program soon after. Emergence, networks, modes of thought, limits of language and expression are what makes me smile (and stay up at night). The combination of lisp and machine learning put me on the path of always striving to make myself redundant if not outright obsolete. Currently working hard to become obsolete at Metabase where I am trying to build an artificial data scientist and imbue visualisations with understanding and context.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/srihari.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/sriharisriraman" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@sriharisriraman</span></a><h3>Srihari Sriraman</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Practical Generative Testing Patterns">Practical Generative Testing Patterns</h3><div class="description">Generative tests are great! But we don’t write them often enough. Why not?
As unit tests, they can be harder to write and read. As stateful acceptance tests, they can be brittle, slow, and unjustifiable.
I’ll discuss some important patterns to leverage generative tests to their potential.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Srihari is a FOSS enthusiast. He has contributed to Gimp, Eclipse, Diaspora and is excited about opportunities to give back. He has been writing Clojure for over 5 years now, and over this time, he has engineered low latency systems, large analytics platforms, monitoring solutions, distributed payment platforms and multiple simulation testing systems.
He is passionate about fostering the Clojure community, conducts workshops, and organizes IN/Clojure. He also works on computational music synthesis and generation as a hobby.
He is a partner at nilenso, a hippie tree hugging bicycle riding software cooperative based in Bangalore.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/wilker.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/wilkerlucio" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@wilkerlucio</span></a><h3>Wilker Lúcio</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Implementing Graph API&apos;s with Clojure">Implementing Graph API's with Clojure</h3><div class="description">REST is taking a rest. Over the past years we are seeing a huge growth of graph API’s with GraphQL leading the way. In this talk I will describe what graph APIs can look like on the Clojure side, and even show you how to achieve the best of both worlds by integrating GraphQL with Clojure graphs!</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: I’m a passionate developer working and learning programming skills since 12 years old, love the way of web development and always researching new technologies. I started real web programming with PHP, but ever trying to learn more and more (passing through Java, Python, C#, ActionScript, Javascript…), currently passionate about Clojure and it’s ecosystem. In recent years I’ve been engaged in the Clojure community, collaborating in projects like Om.next/Fulcro, Devcards, and writing libraries like Pathom.

Scope-capture to the rescue, a new Clojure(Script) library that lets you instantly save and restore local bindings at the REPL.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Valentin Waeselynck is the CTO of BandSquare, a platform providing web and CRM tools for managing audiences, built on top of Clojure and Datomic. He authored a few open-source libraries for Clojure and Datomic, including Datomock, scope-capture and Datofu. On the side, he enjoys doing maths and climbing mountains.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/roland.png"><h3>Dr Roland Kay</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Stay agile with clojure.spec"><span class="lightning">lightning talk</span>Stay agile with clojure.spec</h3><div class="description">You love the sense of liberation and control that Clojurescript gives you and you want the same for your data. A schema for your in-memory data will enable you to change it quickly with confidence. So, the next time that your product manager drops a last minute change request, it will be no stress.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Dr Kay has over ten years experience working in investment banking in London developing financial models and delivering tools which depend on them to trading desks. He came of age with asm, C and C++ and has been using dynamically typed languages to put the power of the core analytics written in C++ in the hands of practitioners who lack extensive software development experience.

He has recently discovered the power of functional programming to tame the complexity of front-end development. He is impressed by the ability of clojure.spec to exceed the level of confidence in code integrity that comes with statically-typed languages while retaining the flexibility and fast-prototyping offered by dynamic languages.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/thomas.png"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/thomasvdv007" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@thomasvdv007</span></a><h3>Thomas van der Veen</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Writing an asynchronous MQTT broker in Clojure (and a bit of Java)"><span class="lightning">lightning talk</span>Writing an asynchronous MQTT broker in Clojure (and a bit of Java)</h3><div class="description">A talk about the attempt to write a MQTT broker with Clojure and some Java and make the whole thing non-blocking where possible so that it can scale really well… hopefully.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Thomas has been writing bits of Clojure since 2011 and in 2016 he gave a talk at the Dutch Clojure Days about using MQTT in a Clojure(Script) application. This time he is back with an MQTT broker written in Clojure and just for good measure he he snug in some Java as well… because you can.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/ray.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/raymcdermott" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@raymcdermott</span></a><h3>Ray McDermott</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="REPtiLe - exercise your lizard brain and share REPLs in a cold-blooded browser"><span class="lightning">lightning talk</span>REPtiLe - exercise your lizard brain and share REPLs in a cold-blooded browser</h3><div class="description">Use REPtiLe to have your own REPL on the web and also see what your team are doing in their REPLs.

This is a story of how we built a backend with Clojure, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Takeaway: when, where, or if this approach fits your problems.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Josh Glover has come a long way since declaring Lisp a completely pointless language in university. 15 years and three countries later, he shudders at the very thought of using a language other than Clojure. He is really interested in teaching programming and increasing diversity in the industry. He currently lives in Stockholm and works for Klarna Bank AB, the leading payments company in the Nordics.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/phillip.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/pmatey" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@pmatey</span></a><h3>Phillip Mates</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="How we test at Nubank">How we test at Nubank</h3><div class="description">Nubank has been shipping business-critical Clojure services for 5+ years. To do so reliably we’ve adopted various approaches to testing, combining unit, integration, & end-to-end tests. This talk will explore our experiences: what’s worked, what hasn’t, and where we are going next with testing</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Coming from a background in theoretical programming language research I’ve been coding Clojure at Nubank for over a year. In this time I’ve become the maintainer of Midje, co-authored a library for validating nested data-structures that produces readable diffs (matcher-combinators), and participated in projects to scale Nubank’s testing infrastructure past 100 microservices. Last Fall I moved to Berlin to help Nubank open its first office outside of Brazil.
