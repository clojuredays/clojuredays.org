de-facto way of building UIs these days. But is it good? Or fast?
<br />
I argue that the web has its unique features, but it also brings a lot of unnecessary complexity to desktop apps, both in performance, resource use, compatibility, and stability.
<br />
Another point is that REPL-driven development is a perfect environment for building UIs, which ClojureScript + Figwheel has proven. Zero time feedback loop + persistent state + no reloads == a blessing for any visual project, yet many modern tools get there.
<br />
Finally, in the true spirit of Clojure and JVM, write once, run anywhere means desktop apps should run the same on all platforms, respecting platforms but also giving a lot of common ground to share development efforts, just like Electron apps do.
<br />
I feel Clojure has a unique opportunity to lead a new era in GUI app development — cross-platform Clojure desktop apps.
<br />
In this talk, we’ll present Humble UI, a brand-new way of building desktop apps in Clojure that doesn’t rely on the web ecosystem or any of the existing cross-platform UI frameworks. Instead, it’s custom-tailored from the ground up for the interactivity and portability of Clojure.
<br />
We’ll talk about graphical stack, OS integration, layout, components and reuse, state management, and also some unique twists you probably always wanted in the UI framework but didn’t know to ask for.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Clojure enthusiast, author of DataScript, Rum, Fira Code</b>
<br />
Nikita has been programming in Clojure, Java, Python, Erlang for 17 years, been interested in UI/UX design for about the same amount of time, and created a few notable projects, including DataScript, Rum and Fira Code.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/gearon.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/quoll" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@quoll</span></a><h3>Paula Gearon</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="A Library Reckoning">A Library Reckoning</h3><div class="description">Clojure was about to release a namespace for doing math, but only on the JVM. Why not ClojureScript as well? When I asked, the answer was that Java offered certain mathematical guarantees. Could ClojureScript offer the same?
The answer turned out to be a lesson in IEEE 754 floating-point numbers; a question of portability between JavaScript and Java; a framework for cross platform testing; discovery of bugs in Clojure; optimizing ClojureScript for the compiler; the ClojureScript contribution process; and finally, renaming the clojure.java.math namespace, along with the creation of a new namespace for ClojureScript.
<br />
This talk will be an introduction to these topics for people who haven't seen them before, and possibly have some interesting things for more advanced developers as well.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Ontology Architect at IMO, and Graph database enthusiast, and Clojurista</b>

The trick? Squeeze it in fewer than 280 characters of Clojure code.
<br />
It was a lot of fun! In this talk, I’d like to share some of that fun with the audience.

Although some efforts are made to make this analysis more readable and capable of representing objects in use - such as the HAMSTERS notation, building such graphs are yet a challenge. A new approach is to consider the automatic generation of such graphs by using a graph visualization tool such as graphviz.
<br />
Tagfl is a lisp interpreter that aggregates multiple s-expressions describing tasks and automatically generates the corresponding graph. This approach helps designers create well-formatted, versionable and extendable task analyses.
It opens the possibility to generate documentation automatically while taking minutes from an interview.
<br />
This talk will go through what and how to use task analysis, followed by a live demo of a task analysis being generated with tagfl.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Founder of UXlambda</b>

From UX designer to Clojure developer, I have been helping companies build user-centred web applications for 6 years as an independent consultant.
<br />
One of my key contributions is with the Starling web portal, an Airbus and Earthworm collaboration to help companies fight deforestation with satellite imagery and supply-chain knowledge: a contribution highlighted at the SIG 2019 conference where I have talked about how to include design principles into gis application.

At the time, Rich already hinted at the potential for "automated correctness analyses" but also stated that "no work has been done on that front for core.async as yet". To celebrate almost a decade of channels in Clojure, let's take another swing at this!
<br />
In this talk, I'll present the Discourje project. In a nutshell, the project allows Clojure programmers to specify communication patterns for core.async usage (as a kind of textual sequence diagrams), after which a run-time monitor can automatically verify channel traffic for compliance. The main correctness guarantee is safety: puts/takes that are forbidden by the spec never take effect (an exception is thrown instead). The project has mathematical foundations and originates from research on type systems in Computer Science, but that's all outside the scope of this talk.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Assistant professor at Open University of the Netherlands</b>
<br/>
Sung-Shik Jongmans is assistant professor at Open University of the Netherlands and researcher at the Dutch National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI, Amsterdam). His interests include programming languages, concurrency theory, and software engineering. Since he met Clojure a few years back, he's been excited to use the language to explore new research ideas. His long term aim: to make concurrent programming easier.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/jmiller.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/lambduhh" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@lambduhh</span></a><h3>Jordan Miller</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Got a Guru?">Got a Guru?</h3><div class="description">Do you have a mentor? You definitely should. Guidance and mentorship is essential to growth and is relevant during all stages of an engineer’s career. Intentionally forming and maintaining these types of positive relationships ensures your professional progression and inspires a sense of well-being. Giving and receiving knowledge has a trickle down effect that touches and changes lives. Engaging in this practice can be one of the most impactful things that you do.
<br />
For some folks, establishing this type of interpersonal connection comes less naturally, especially as we advance in our careers. Going beyond *why* seeking and offering guidance is vital, we’ll explore *how* to form this type of alliance from an architect's perspective. Visualizing how to build, integrate and sustain these processes so that kinship based on meaningful knowledge sharing becomes second nature. Illustrating practices that work on an individual level and that have the propensity to scale to create a culture of mentorship within any group, community or company.
<br />
At Vouch.io we've carefully cultivated this kind of culture organically and would love to share our secrets with the larger clj(s) community!</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Software Engineer at Vouch.io</b>

With babashka it is very easy to sneak in a small script at your non-Clojure job. Similar for nbb: writing a Node script for your colleagues who just use NPM became easy.
<br />
What if we could pull off the same trick with ClojureScript in the browser?
<br />
What if sneaking in a little bit of ClojureScript into a JavaScript project was as easy as installing one extra library in your package.json? What if interop between JavaScript and .cljs files was seamless? What if JS devs could still use Node for all your tooling and didn't have to pull in a JVM? What if you could publish libraries with compiled CLJS to NPM that all share the same CLJS core functions?
<br />
Would this increase the adoption of ClojureScript in the mainstream? Would this approach be helpful to existing ClojureScript users for a new category of projects? In this talk we're getting a glimpse of what that may look like.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: <b>Clojure OSS developer</b>
