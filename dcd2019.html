It wasn’t easy, it took a lot of work, I learned many valuable lessons along the way, and I want to share all of this with you! This talk is going to examine the efforts that lead to restarting the active nREPL development in 2018, the current state of the project and the ambitious plans for its future. As almost all Clojure developers rely on nREPL in one way or another (e.g. cider-jack-in or lein repl), I believe that many of you might find this talk both interesting and informative! A maybe even fun! ;-)</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: Bozhidar is the maintainer of CIDER, nREPL and many Clojure libraries related to Clojure tooling. He’s also the editor of the community Clojure style guide. Most people would probably describe him as an Emacs zealot (and they would be right). He’s also quite fond of the Lisp family of languages, functional programming in general and Clojure in particular.
Believe it or not, Bozhidar has hobbies and interests outside the realm of computers, but we won’t bore with those here.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/bcambel.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/bahadircambel" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@bahadircambel</span></a><h3>Bahadir Cambel</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Building BNR Smart Radio &amp; FD.nl Recommender system using Clojure &amp; Serverless Architecture">Building BNR Smart Radio & FD.nl Recommender system using Clojure & Serverless Architecture</h3><div class="description">Managing servers and infrastructure is a costly, time consuming huge pain.

He is passionate about delivering clean, well tested code, that is easy for others to understand. He is well experienced with over 15 years of software development, and adept at bridging the gap between the front-end and back-end teams. He was responsible for large rewrites of core architecture behind the BBC Sport and BBC News platforms, and worked as a consultant for JUXT, where he helped to develop a large Clojure(script) application used by traders at Credit Suisse, along with many years of Scala development before finding a home with Clojure.

Discourje extends core.async and offers high-level abstractions to define message exchange patterns that are run-time validated and enforced between threads.</div><div class="bio">About the speaker: I got in touch with Clojure while reading about Java concurrency and was instantly fascinated by the elegance of Clojure’s syntax and macros. Inspired and enthused by previous research on high-level abstractions for MEPs (e.g., in Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Go), I initiated the Discourje project to bring such abstractions for the first time to Clojure. As a part-time master student at Open Universiteit, I am currently finishing my MSc thesis on Discourje (and its underlying formal theory!). In my full-time day-to-day job, I work as a software engineer at BlueTea (www.bluetea.nl) where we build virtual simulations and serious games.</div></div></div><div class="speaker"><div class="name"><img src="img/speakers/borkdude.jpg"><a class="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/borkdude" target="_blank"><span class="twitter-handle">@borkdude</span></a><h3>Michiel Borkent</h3></div><div class="info"><h3 class="title" id="Re-find: discover functions with spec"><span class="lightning">lightning talk</span>Re-find: discover functions with spec</h3><div class="description">Re-find is an app and a library that lets you interactively discover Clojure functions based on example in- and output values or predicates.
