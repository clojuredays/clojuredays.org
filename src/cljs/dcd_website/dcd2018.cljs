Emergence, networks, modes of thought, limits of language and expression are what makes me smile (and stay up at night). The combination of lisp and machine learning put me on the path of always striving to make myself redundant if not outright obsolete. Currently working hard to become obsolete at Metabase where I am trying to build an artificial data scientist and imbue visualisations with understanding and context."

In recent years I’ve been engaged in the Clojure community, collaborating in projects like Om.next/Fulcro, Devcards, and writing libraries like Pathom.

A schema for your in-memory data will enable you to change it quickly with confidence. So, the next time that your product manager drops a last minute change request, it will be no stress."

He came of age with asm, C and C++ and has been using dynamically typed languages to put the power of the core analytics written in C++ in the hands of practitioners who lack extensive software development experience.

He has recently discovered the power of functional programming to tame the complexity of front-end development. He is impressed by the ability of clojure.spec to exceed the level of confidence in code integrity that comes with statically-typed languages while retaining the flexibility and fast-prototyping offered by dynamic languages."

This talk will explore our experiences: what’s worked, what hasn’t, and where we are going next with testing"

In this time I’ve become the maintainer of Midje, co-authored a library for validating nested data-structures that produces readable diffs (matcher-combinators), and participated in projects to scale Nubank’s testing infrastructure past 100 microservices. Last Fall I moved to Berlin to help Nubank open its first office outside of Brazil. In Berlin, my colleagues and I are focused on building data infrastructure for São Paulo-based analysts and engineers to use."
