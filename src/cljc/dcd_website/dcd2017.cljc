By applying this chaotic testing technique to the user interface and the application as a whole, he has found bugs, gained new insight, and ultimately had a lot of fun."

    :description  "Few months ago our company NomNom decided to move all its backend services from Ruby to Clojure. And I think a road trip is best comparison for this migration. There was excitement at start, then panic a few hours down the road wondering what was left behind,  but now a constant joy of discovering new things. In this talk I’d like to share how we eventually arrived at Stuart Sierra’s Component. Let’s take a look at how components improved our quickly growing codebase and testing, as well as some of the trade-offs we had to make. Finally I’ll show how components can help with managing running code in production."

    :description  "Clojure has always been good at manipulating data. With the release of spec and Onyx (\"masterless, cloud scale, fault tolerant, high performance distributed computation system\") good became best. In this talk I will walk you through a data layer architecture build around Kafka an Onyx that is self-describing, declarative, scalable and convenient to work with for the end user. The focus will be on the power and elegance of describing data and computation with data; and the inferences and automations that can be built on top of that."

Anyone with a working knowledge of the language will be able to understand the puzzles, but even the most senior Clojure master will be puzzled. The interactive talk format is entertaining while the puzzles teach you about the subtleties of Clojure and its standard library."
